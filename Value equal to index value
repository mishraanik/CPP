Value equal to index value

Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}
Output: 2
Explanation: Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.

Solution:  

class Solution{
public:

	vector<int> valueEqualToIndex(int arr[], int n) 
	{
	    vector<int> equal;
	    for(int i =0; i<n; i++)
	    {
	        int index = i+1;
	        if(arr[i]==  index )
	        {
	            equal.push_back(index);
	            index++;
	        }
	        
	    }
	    return equal;
	}
};
